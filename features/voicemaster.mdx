If your Mintlify instance doesn't support the `<Video>` component, you can use this fallback HTML (uncomment if needed):

<!--
<video controls style={{ maxWidth: '100%' }}>
  <source src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1420164397837451306/1425206377923743765/Desktop_2025.10.07_-_15.36.56.03.mp4?ex=68e6be5f&is=68e56cdf&hm=7c0119ec8c13b14f661fff7442937d439b7ae63a572744894a39f3016d1f6aac&" type="video/mp4" />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
